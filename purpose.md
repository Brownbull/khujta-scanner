OK, the purpose of this project is basically to create a project that will use Claude Code and the Claude Code Chrome extension to test different applications that we are developing. The idea is that we might give you a little bit of context, and that we create, navigate applications, and try to use them as different users, and generate reports with issues or workflows that are broken. Anything that can contribute from the user standpoint.
